Welcome to the new home of Wintin on the web. 

Wintin 95 and Wintin.Net are Mud clients that support the popular Tintin++ scripting language. They are fully-fledged Windows apps, rather than command-line clients. They are not under active development and are not supported, but both will run under Windows (including Windows 10) and are available for download here as I know that people still use them.

## Wintin 95 ##

Wintin 95 was a port of Tintin++ to Windows. Click on the 'Download' link to the left download it. Save it in the folder you want to run Wintin from: preferably an empty folder.  When the file has downloaded, double-click on it to install Wintin. Then double-click on Wintin95.exe to run it. You can find some support and information on the archived website available from the Wayback Machine - click on the Website Archive link.

## Wintin.Net ##

Wintin.Net has a ground-up re-implementation of the Tintin++ script language, with some extensions. It's also possible to write script in .Net-based languages. Wintin.Net uses the putty terminal client code and has pretty complete ANSI terminal support. The version available for download here was updated by rk487 to run under .Net v4, compiled in Visual Studio 2010. To install, click on the 'Download' link to download the .7z archive. Unpack it with Peazip or another archive program, then double-click on setup.exe to install. Again, you can find some additional info in the Wayback Machine's archive by clicking on the Website Archive link. 

Be safe!
